# PyIndex_v2.0
An educational project to explore and create a node tree to index a large list of words.

## Instructions
Just run the demo to try it out: \
\
$ python3 demo.py \
\
I used a wordlist from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words containing various english words. With small adjustments any list of words can be used.
